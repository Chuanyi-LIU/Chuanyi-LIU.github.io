### **Research Assistant**  
**2025 – Present | School of Fashion and Textiles, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University**  

I participated in the development of an intelligent thermo-fluidic system for waste-heat and wastewater recovery in denim processing. The system leverages a thermosiphon-driven vacuum evaporation–condensation mechanism to simultaneously reclaim thermal energy and clean water without external energy sources. By coupling computational fluid dynamics (CFD) with neural-network-based adaptive control, the project achieves real-time optimization of flow dynamics, pressure distribution, and heat-transfer efficiency. This integrated design not only improves energy recovery rates and operational stability but also demonstrates a scalable solution for low-carbon and sustainable textile manufacturing.
